#### Embark on a Journey of Experiential Learning

Our Shanghai Program is meticulously designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the societal, historical, and commercial aspects of China.

These activities are aimed at giving participants a complete and in-depth understanding of the intricate layers of Chinese culture.

#### Standout Features Redefining Learning

What sets our summer camp apart is its commitment to diverse teaching methodologies and an emphasis on experiential learning.

#### Beyond the Classroom: Cultural Experiences Unveiled

As part of the programme, students will delve into Shanghai's cultural riches through a series of meticulously planned activities. A guided tour of the iconic Bund and Lujiazui Financial Center unveils the historical and modern architectural contrasts of Shanghai. Exploring Yu Garden provides insights into traditional Chinese architecture, while a Huangpu River Night Cruise presents the city's illuminated skyline.

Day trips to ancient water towns like Zhujiajiao and historical sites such as Guangfulin further enrich the cultural tapestry. Engaging in a Chinese calligraphy workshop and participating in a simulated marketplace, where students act as buyers in Best Buyer, ensures a blend of tradition and modernity.

Dine with Locals and Savor Shanghai's Flavors

Our Chinese Table experience brings students closer to the heart of Shanghai by allowing them to dine with residents. This fosters cultural integration as students join locals for traditional meals, listen to their stories, and enhance cross-cultural understanding.

For gastronomic adventurers, the Best Food Review activity lets participants taste and review various dishes, articulating their experiences in Mandarin through food reviews. In this journey, even the act of dining becomes a cultural exploration.
